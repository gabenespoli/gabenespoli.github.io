      <description>Perceiving emotion in speech is a common shortcoming of modern day hearing aids, which can often lead to difficulties understanding others. This project uses physiological measures to see the effects of hearing aids on physiological responses to emotion. Specifically we investigated skin conductance levels (SCL; a &amp;ldquo;sweat&amp;rdquo; response that is a good indicator of general arousal) in hearing-impaired and -aided listeners when listening to happy, sad, angry, and calm speech.</description>

      <title>The neuroscience of music and movement: How does music make us move?</title>

      <description>Motivation I love playing and listening to music. Especially music that catches your attention and makes you tap your foot or bob your head. As an organ player I&amp;rsquo;m particularly partial to examples like this, but I feel obliged to include more common examples of high-groove music like this or this.
When listening to music, neurons in the brain can synchronize their firing with the beat. This neural entrainment is how we are able to predict when the next beat will occur, and thus how we can tap our feet or dance along.</description>
