      <description>Motivation I love playing and listening to music. Especially music that catches your attention and makes you tap your foot or bob your head. As an organ player I&amp;rsquo;m particularly partial to examples like this, but I feel obliged to include more common examples of high-groove music like this or this.
When listening to music, neurons in the brain can synchronize their firing with the beat. This neural entrainment is how we are able to predict when the next beat will occur, and thus how we can tap our feet or dance along.</description>
