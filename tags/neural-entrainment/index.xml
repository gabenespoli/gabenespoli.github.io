      <description>When listening to music, neurons in the brain can synchronize their firing with the beat. This neural entrainment is how we are able to predict when the next beat will occur, and thus how we can tap our feet or dance along. The ability of different music to compel movement in a listener varies, and this is likely also true of neural entrainment. This project investigates certain psychological, acoustic, and musical features of music&amp;mdash;that have previously been found to create a desire to move&amp;mdash;in their ability to entrain neurons in premotor areas of the brain.</description>
