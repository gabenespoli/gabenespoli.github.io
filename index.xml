Summary I am PhD Candidate and aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for coding my way out of complex problems. My current work explores how brains represent music, and why tapping your foot can be irresistible. I am graduating in September and will be looking to start a career in data science.</description>

      <description>phzlab (MATLAB): Probably my biggest coding achievement, PHZLAB is a MATLAB Toolbox for analyzing physiological data, both peripheral and neural. It is in active use in my department and does a great job organizing your labelled signals and plotting them in different combinations.
neuroscience of music and movement: When listening to music, neurons in the brain can synchronize their firing with the beat. This neural entrainment is how we are able to predict when the next beat will occur, and thus how we can tap our feet or dance along.</description>

      <description>Perceiving emotion in speech is a common shortcoming of modern day hearing aids, which can often lead to difficulties understanding others. This project uses physiological measures to see the effects of hearing aids on physiological responses to emotion. Specifically we investigated skin conductance levels (SCL; a &amp;ldquo;sweat&amp;rdquo; response that is a good indicator of general arousal) in hearing-impaired and -aided listeners when listening to happy, sad, angry, and calm speech.</description>

      <description>When listening to music, neurons in the brain can synchronize their firing with the beat. This neural entrainment is how we are able to predict when the next beat will occur, and thus how we can tap our feet or dance along. The ability of different music to compel movement in a listener varies, and this is likely also true of neural entrainment. This project investigates certain psychological, acoustic, and musical features of music&amp;mdash;that have previously been found to create a desire to move&amp;mdash;in their ability to entrain neurons in premotor areas of the brain.</description>
