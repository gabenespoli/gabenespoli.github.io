      <description>I have had a tough time finding this information online in one place, so I thought I would amalgamate it here. Many of the descriptions come from a Fast Balls article from 2007, but there have been many variables added since then. In most cases it was obvious so I&amp;rsquo;ve spelled out a description.
   Variable Name Description     index A unique identification number per pitch within a game.</description>

      <description>I am a neuro- and data scientist who develops tools for finding meaningful insights in huge amounts of messy data. I recently received a PhD for studying how the brain tracks the beat in music, and how this can create an irresistible urge to move along. I specialize in signal processing and EEG data, but have a rapidly developing interest in machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence. If I&amp;rsquo;m not coding, I&amp;rsquo;m probably at the park with the kids, cooking, or playing the B3.</description>

      <description>This is a list of some of my coding projects, ordered roughly by size (in lines of code), time (since the start of the project), and effort (in grief caused).
PHZLAB (MATLAB) Probably my biggest coding achievement, PHZLAB is a MATLAB Toolbox for analyzing physiological data, both peripheral and neural. It is in active use in my department and does a great job organizing your labelled signals and plotting them in different combinations.</description>

      <title>Hearing aids and phsyiological responses to emotion</title>

      <description>Perceiving emotion in speech is a common shortcoming of modern day hearing aids, which can often lead to difficulties understanding others. This project uses physiological measures to see the effects of hearing aids on physiological responses to emotion. Specifically we investigated skin conductance levels (SCL; a &amp;ldquo;sweat&amp;rdquo; response that is a good indicator of general arousal) in hearing-impaired and -aided listeners when listening to happy, sad, angry, and calm speech.</description>

      <description>When listening to music, neurons in the brain can synchronize their firing with the beat. This neural entrainment is how we are able to predict when the next beat will occur, and thus how we can tap our feet or dance along. The ability of different music to compel movement in a listener varies, and this is likely also true of neural entrainment. This project investigates certain psychological, acoustic, and musical features of music&amp;mdash;that have previously been found to create a desire to move&amp;mdash;in their ability to entrain neurons in premotor areas of the brain.</description>
