<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>I love playing and listening to music. Especially music that catches your attention and makes you tap your foot or bob your head. As an organ player I&rsquo;m particularly partial to examples like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ3f1Y8Aw_U">this</a>, but I feel obliged to include more common examples of high-groove music like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ul7X5js1vE">this</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1vgO8fba1U">this</a>.</p>

<p>When listening to music, neurons in the brain can synchronize their firing with the beat. This neural entrainment is how we are able to predict when the next beat will occur, and thus how we can tap our feet or dance along. The ability of different music to compel movement in a listener varies, and this is likely also true of neural entrainment. This project investigates certain psychological, acoustic, and musical features of music&mdash;that have previously been found to create a desire to move&mdash;in their ability to entrain neurons in premotor areas of the brain. If a certain feature is good at entraining neurons that are related to planning movement, then it is likely that this is a feature that will create a desire to move in the listener.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved music more than anything else in life. I think my passion came from my mom, who might love live music more than I do. She pushed me to start playing drums when I was nine years old, alto saxophone when I was ten, and singing when in high school.</p>

<p>I grew up listening to some of the best guitar players of all time: John Frusciante (RHCP), Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead), and Trey Anastasio (Phish). Because of this I&rsquo;ve developed an obsession with jam bands, improvisation, guitar solos, and guitars. Last year I finally started learning to play guitar, and it has changed my life! It has without a doubt become my favorite hobby, and I look forward to playing guitar every day after work.</p>

<p>I frequently browse eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and Reverb for used guitars. However, I&rsquo;m often times not sure if a guitar listing is a good deal or not. Ideally I would be able to tell if a guitar sale was a good deal quickly and reliably, so that I could buy it before someone else does!</p>

<p>So… I decided to build a guitar pricing model for myself using guitar sales available on Reverb.com and machine learning! Hopefully, when I have enough money, I can use this model to help guide my purchase of my dream 1960&rsquo;s Fender Stratocaster.</p>

<h2 id="pipeline">PIPELINE</h2>

<p>Data: ~35,000 electric guitar sales scraped from Reverb.com</p>

<p>Tools: Python + Selenium + Pandas + StatsModels + SKLearn</p>

<h2 id="data">DATA</h2>

<p>Target (Predicting):</p>

<p>Selling Price</p>

<p>Features (Predictor):</p>

<p>Brand
Model Year
Color
Condition
Asking Price</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately due to the complexity of the web page titles (shown above), I was unable to use ‘Model’ as a feature</strong></p>

<h2 id="data-exploration">DATA EXPLORATION</h2>

<p>Before diving into the model creation and evaluation process, let&rsquo;s take a look at some visualizations of the data.</p>

<h3 id="target-predicting-guitar-selling-price">Target (Predicting) — Guitar Selling Price</h3>

<p>The above chart shows the probability density function (pdf) of guitar selling prices in this data set. This is essentially just a visualization of the distribution of guitar prices. I chose to only model guitars between \$0 and \$40000, as there were some guitars as high as \$300000 that were just too hard to model. As you can see the majority of guitars fall between \$0 and \$5000 dollars, with few guitars being greater than \$5000. Later on you will see that modeling guitars greater than \$5000 created some problems for me!</p>

<h3 id="feature-guitar-brand">Feature — Guitar Brand</h3>

<p>The above visualization shows the distribution of each guitar brand&rsquo;s selling price. Along with limiting this analysis to guitars selling between \$0 and \$40000, I also limited this to the top 20 guitar brands by number of sales. The interesting thing to note here is that brands like Rickenbacker and Gibson sell for much higher prices than starter brands like Squier. This means that guitar brand could be a powerful feature for predicting guitar selling price.</p>

<h3 id="feature-guitar-model-year">Feature — Guitar Model Year</h3>

<p>The above chart shows the selling price of guitar&rsquo;s by their model year. The thing that sticks out to me is that 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s guitars sell at higher prices than other guitar years. This is likely due to the fact that companies like Fender and Gibson came out with their original guitars during this time, which have since become collectors’ items. I for one love late 50&rsquo;s and early 60&rsquo;s Fender Stratocasters!</p>

<h3 id="feature-guitar-condition">Feature — Guitar Condition</h3>

<p>The above chart of each guitar condition&rsquo;s selling price distribution shows a few interesting points. The first is that guitars in Excellent condition sell on median at higher prices than guitars in Mint condition. This may be due to the fact that older, often more sought after guitars are usually not in Mint condition. The second is that guitars in Excellent, Mint, Very Good, and Good conditions have very similar selling price distributions, however guitars in Fair and Poor conditions have a clear drop off in their selling price distribution.</p>

<h3 id="feature-guitar-color">Feature — Guitar Color</h3>

<p>The major take-away from the above chart is that there is a clear difference between different color&rsquo;s selling price distributions. This again means that guitar color could be a powerful feature for predicting guitar selling price.</p>

<h2 id="pricing-model-evaluation">PRICING MODEL EVALUATION</h2>

<p>Linear Regression Models
After exploring my scraped data through visualizations I built a predictive model using OLS linear regression. I tested many different feature sets, with different transformations, and have a few highlighted below. I used a 70-30 train-test split for model validation.</p>

<p>The first model listed, which used a log10 transform on the selling price and asking price, had the best results on holdout data with an average prediction error of \$300.82 and an average prediction error percent of 8.36%.</p>

<p>The second model listed did not use any transformations of the data. This model performed almost as well on holdout data (even better depending on the metric) with an average prediction error of \$299.45 and an average prediction error percent of 9.14%. This is the model I chose as ‘the best’ since it had very good results, and is easily explainable.</p>

<p>The third model listed used a log10 transform on the selling price, but dropped asking price from being used as a feature / predictor. This model performed significantly worse on holdout data with an average prediction error of \$1810.62 and an average prediction error percent of 49.92%. This shows how heavily my model relies on asking price as a predictor. Ideally, this model would be powerful without needing the asking price. If only I was able to get the guitar model from Reverb…</p>

<h3 id="linear-regression-model-error">Linear Regression Model Error</h3>

<p>The above chart shows my linear regression model&rsquo;s residuals across different selling prices. The residuals are calculated to be the difference between the estimated guitar selling prices and the true selling prices. As selling price goes above about \$5000, the residuals start to increase in magnitude (heteroskedasticity). This is due to the fact that guitars greater than \$5000 become increasingly hard to model at the same time as guitars less than \$5000. If I was to redo this study I would only model guitars between \$0 and \$5000!</p>

<h3 id="other-regression-models">Other Regression Models</h3>

<p>After deciding on the Target and Features based on my above linear regression analysis, I decided to briefly compare linear regression against some other machine learning regression techniques shown below.</p>

<p>It turns out that plain old linear regression turned out to have the best predictive power on holdout data with an adjusted R-squared of 0.979. This means that the linear regression model was able to account for 97.9% of the variation in the guitar selling price data (around its mean).</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</h2>

<p>Although I had a great time doing this analysis, the overall model that I built is not very useful since it relies heavily on using asking price to predict selling price. If I was able to include guitar model this may significantly increase my models’ predictive power without needing asking price. In the future I may connect to Reverb&rsquo;s API to try and gather this information.</p>

<p>If a model was able to reliably predict a used guitar&rsquo;s selling price this would be an extremely powerful tool for both buyers and sellers. It could be the Kelley Blue Book of guitars!</p>
